Some useful bundles.

Installation
------------

### Step 1: Download the package

Open your composer.json file and add the Nines Bundles repository.

```json
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "github",
            "url": "https://github.com/ubermichael/nines-bundles.git"
        }
    ],

```

Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute the
following command to download the latest stable version of this bundle:

```console
$ composer require ubermichael/nines 1.x-dev
```

This command requires you to have Composer installed globally, as explained
in the [installation chapter](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
of the Composer documentation.
